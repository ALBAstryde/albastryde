    """Version of the Django ``Library`` class that can handle both
    Django template engine tags and filters, as well as Jinja2
    extensions and filters.

    Tries to present a common registration interface to the extension
    author, but provides both template engines with only those
    components they can support.

    Since custom Django tags and Jinja2 extensions are two completely
    different beasts, they are handled completely separately. You can
    register custom Django tags as usual, for example:

        register.tag('current_time', do_current_time)

    Or register a Jinja2 extension like this:

        register.tag(CurrentTimeNode)

    Filters, on the other hand, work similarily in both engines, and
    for the most one can't tell whether a filter function was written
    for Django or Jinja2. A compatibility layer is used to make to
    make the filters you register usuable with both engines:

        register.filter('cut', cut)

    However, some of the more powerful filters just won't work in
    Django, for example if more than one argument is required, or if
    context- or environmentfilters are used. If ``cut`` in the above
    example where such an extended filter, it would only be registered
    with Jinja.

    See also the module documentation for ``coffin.interop`` for
    information on some of the limitations of this conversion.

    TODO: Jinja versions of the ``simple_tag`` and ``inclusion_tag``
    helpers would be nice, though since custom tags are not needed as
    often in Jinja, this is not urgent.
